'''Selection sort- Find the smallest number in the unsorted part of the list.
Swap it with the number at the beginning of the unsorted part.Repeat this for rest of the list.
The smallest elements get placed at the beginning after each pass.
1.Define the selection_sort function taking array arr as input
2.Get the length of the array
3.Outer loop to fix one position at a time
4.Assume the current index holds the smallest value
5.Inner loop to find the smallest element in the unsorted part
6&7.If a smaller element is found, Update the index of the smallest element
8.Swap the found minimum element with the first unsorted element
11.Call selection_sort function to sort the array'''
