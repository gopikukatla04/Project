'''Bubble Sort - Simple Comparison Based Sorting
It works by comparing neighboring elements and swapping them if they are out of order. 
This process repeats until the list is sorted.
The biggest elements move up to the end of the list after each pass.

1. Define the bubble_sort function taking array arr as input
2. Get length of the array
3. Outer loop for n passes-one for each element
4. Inner loop to compare side by elements
5 & 6. If current element is greater than next element, Swap elements to correct order
9.Call bubble_sort function to sort the array '''


def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                # Swap the elements because of incorrect order
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original Array:", arr)
bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted Array:", arr)
